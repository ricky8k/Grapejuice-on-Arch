*Also known as Roblox on Steam Deck and Arch Linux*

This guide serves as an easier reference for inexperienced Linux users (like myself), [as this guide is a bit sparse](https://brinkervii.gitlab.io/grapejuice/docs/Installing-from-package/Arch-Linux-and-similar.html).

*I cannot guarantee this guide will work for everyone (especially with my limited Linux knowledge). If something doesn't work as intended, [you might find a fix here](https://github.com/ricky8k/Grapejuice-on-Arch#Troubleshooting).*

**I recommend you read the guide in its entirety before proceeding.**
